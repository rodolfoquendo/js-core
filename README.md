# js-core

## Why?

We have to keep in mind that all the javascript that is rendered in a browser is public
So i will start doing all my javascript in the form of npm packages

This is the main one, this is the general stuff that i use
this will be growing with everything that i need to rebuild insignia in a maintainable and scalable way

## Testing

```bash
npm install && npm test && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### coverage html report

```bash
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```
